Q:Print the confusion matrix and overall accuracy for three identifiers.
A:See `Task.py`.

Q:Compare the results for PCA feature and LDA feature, which feature is better? Why?
A:The overall accuracy of PCA identify is 74.17% ,while LDA identify is 100%.
  Obviously, LDA identifier performs better. The reason is --- PCA is unsupervised
  but LDA is supervised, so while do LDA projection, the distance between classes does
  effect on the final identify results.

Q:Let alpha = 0.1, 0.2...0.9. Retrain your identifier for fused feature and re-calculate its
  accuracy for each alpha. Plot accuracy versus alpha for different alpha. Submit this plot. What
  do you observe?
A:With the increasing of alpha value,the corresponding accuracy is decreasing.

Q:Does the fused feature outperform both PCA feature and LDA feature? Why?
A:Fused feature perform better than PCA feature but in most cases worse than LDA
  feature.Because LDA is supervised but PCA is not, and number of samples is quite
  limited, so LDA performs better in this case.When alpha value increases,the corresponding
  accuracy decreases,because when alpha value is small, LDA feature weights more in
  fused feature.And actually, the optimal alpha value dependent on specific scenes.
