(c)
Q:Re-calculate x. What do you notice?
A: when the b is recorrected, x turn out to be [0.01;0.01],
 which is the right answer. And the error in A was squared by x, then shown in b.

(d)
Q:Using the result of part (b), explain what happened in part (c).
A:explain:
Since the kp(A) is so big ,so when there is error in b,
the corresponding error in x is multiplied many times, and it seems quietly different.
